# Android Practice Repository

Here I post some of the Android code that I practice once a while along with what the project actually does. Different functionalities will be added as time passes. <br/>

Clone this repository, and try to open the folders inside the repo with Android studio. I've written the programs with Java(not Kotlin). Any queries/help can be submitted through issues.

### Projects :


* intent: This is a basic practice application on how to use intents. The intens can be found in the MainActivity file. I've used 3 intents: <br/> a) Browser b) Telephone c) Location(Google Maps). <br/>
* stocks: I've used apadters inside the Quote class and also a factory for the API Service using retrofit2 and also the retrofit2 GSON converter. <br/>
* SharePrefs: Small application to test out various ways to share preferences, etc
